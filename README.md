# Quick Zoom
Use the scroll wheel to quickly adjust your zoom scale without having to go through a menu.

## Installation
This mod depends on the [Return Of Modding](https://github.com/return-of-modding/ReturnOfModding) loader:
1. Download the [latest Return Of Modding release](https://github.com/return-of-modding/ReturnOfModding/releases)
2. Follow the [Manual Installation instructions](https://github.com/return-of-modding/ReturnOfModding#manual-installation) to install Return Of Modding
3. Run the game once with Return Of Modding to generate the relevant folders
4. Download this package and extract the package folder into the `ReturnOfModding/plugins` folder (should be similar to the Creating mods with Return Of Modding section)
5. Ping me if it breaks..

## Config
A config file will generate in the `ReturnOfModding/config` folder. By default the zoom scaling has some smoothing (mostly for large jumps when pixel-perfect scaling is enabled) but this can be disabled if you want snappier zoom. Also has some other options for zoom speed, limits, etc.
